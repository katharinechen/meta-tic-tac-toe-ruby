## H2 How To Play

Imagine a game of tic-tac-toe where each individual spaces of the board is another tic-tac-toe game. That is meta-tic-tac-toe. 

Meta Tic-Tac-Toe requires 2 players to play, respectively donning the symbols "X" and "O". Player

Win 3 mini tic-tac-toe boards in a row before your opponent, and you will have conquered meta-tic-tac-toe. However, remember there are two additional rules. First, the space where one player plays on the miniboard determines where the next player can play on the metaboard.
