## How To Play

Imagine a game of tic-tac-toe where each individual spaces of the board is another tic-tac-toe game. That is meta-tic-tac-toe. 

Meta Tic-Tac-Toe requires 2 players, "X" and "O". The objective of the game is to win 3 mini tic-tac-toe boards in a row before your opponent. The one of the main difference between this game and tic-tac-toe is that the space where one player plays on the miniboard determines where the next player can play on the metaboard.
